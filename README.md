# 2D bouncing ball simulation

A simple 2D bouncing ball simulation using an HTML canvas. In this simulation, a ball moves around the screen in any direction, including diagonals, based on its velocity. When the ball hits the edges of the canvas (representing the screen boundaries), it bounces off by reversing its direction and the color is changed randomly on every collusion.
